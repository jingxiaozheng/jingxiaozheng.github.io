Hi there! I'm the final year PhD candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland, College Park. My advisor is [Prof. Rama Chellappa](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/). I am also affiliated with the [University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/).

My research interests include deep learning, face recognition, video analysis, action recognition and dictionary learning.

I worked as a research intern at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/) in Summer 2017, advised by [Dr. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my M.S. degree from University of Maryland in 2014 and B.E. degree in Information Engineering from [Southeast University, Nanjing](http://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) in 2012.
